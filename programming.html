        <h2>Phases of computer program development:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
            <li> Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
            <li> Phase 3: Write the program code in approprate language based on the algorithm</li>
            <li> Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
            <li> Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
            <li> Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Programming Structures</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Structure: Top-downm execution</li>
            <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
            <li>Iterative (looping): while loop: continue looping as long something is true</li>
            <li> Repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true </li>
            <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
            <li>Recursive structures: Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
            <li>Repetition continues until: degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met (degenerative case is also called a "base case")</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Two Classic Programming/Database Problems</h2>
        <h3>Sorting: Decending order/Ascending order</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>soritng numbers
            <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Searching: Fomd specific data that meet a certain criteria</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In database</li>
            <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
            <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Two popular search techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
            <li>Binary search: only workds if data is SORTED first, start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Two Classic program goals:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficientcy: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
            <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>
        </ul>
